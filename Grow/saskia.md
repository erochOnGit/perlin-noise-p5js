## How to work everyday

how did she start to work :
geometric obsession (grids etc)

what she explained is
how use tools to work every day

Hexels is a grid creation tool.
Back to programming interaction design.
when she started work on proceessing and openframework
she was bad and not doing it because of stronger guys
joshua davis classroom Hype framework for design background

then saskia begins to create some of animations and generative pictures
she tried to break the perfect grid want
and she just told herself do it every day a month so she couls not make perfect things she had no time.

then the next year she wanted do it 2 month because she thought she'll run out of idea .. but she had a lot of idea and she keep doing it

## exemple

she use not a grid but a grid with less point randomly generated

make shapes on the points of the grid then
color them

put a random size randomness is cool

4 random shape
4 random colors
5 random size
4 random stroke weight

## thought

make circular grid
all is about repetition
usings differents shapes
making things intersting visually

keep on exploring
make challenge = add new rules
example : use same color 3 days in a row

more iteration of one exploration.

## then saskia decided to focus on something

Like animation. You don't have to invente things you have to explore how you want to do.

To search other approach you can use different tools.
new start are ugly you will have beautiful things after some time.

### _to create make rules ..._

### _to go further ... break your rules ..._
